                <h2>What is Listing Quota on MokeSell</h2>
                
                <p class="lead-text">Listing quota refers to the number of listings you can create or mark as active within a specific time frame. The duration of this time frame can vary depending on the country of your marketplace. </p>

                <h2>How does Listing Quota work?</h2>
                <div class="info-boxx">
                    <p>Each seller is allocated a certain number of free listings in each category. This free quota refreshes periodically, the frequency may differ depending on the country of your marketplace.</p>
                    <p>A quota is consumed once a listing is successfully listed as active. Deleting or marking a listing as sold/reserved does not free up the used quota.</p>
                    <p>When a seller uses up their free quota in a category, they can either purchase a MokeBiz subscription, additional custom quota, or wait for the free quota to refresh to list more items.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="alert-message">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Due to market dynamics, listing quotas vary by category and are different in each country where MokeSell operates. We have 2 different quota systems that apply to (a) the General goods categories, and (b) Autos, Property, Jobs, and Services categories.

                    <ul class="tips-list">
                        <li>
                            Encourage sellers to maintain their inventory with fresh, up to date listings to increase the quality of listings in the marketplace.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Provides visibility for sellers' listings which helps their items sell faster.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduce the number of duplicate listings, spam or low quality listings to make it easy for buyers to find their desired items in the marketplace.
