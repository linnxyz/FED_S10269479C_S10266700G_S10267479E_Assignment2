        <h1>Can I have more than one Carousell account?</h1>

        <h2>In line with Carousell’s commitment to creating a safe marketplace, you may only have one account on Carousell unless expressly permitted.</h2>
        <p>We understand that every seller and buyer is unique and may have different needs. If you require more than one account on Carousell, let us know, and we’ll assess your request.</p>

        <h2>What is an account limit?</h2>
        <p>Upon signing up for an account, you may encounter a pop-up message informing you that you've reached your account limit. This happens because you already have an existing Carousell account. To resume your Carousell activities, simply log in to your existing Carousell account.</p>

        <p>If you've deactivated your account previously, you may reactivate your account instead of creating a new one.</p>

        <p>If you've forgotten your password for an existing Carousell account, you may reset it in forget password</a>.</p>
