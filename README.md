**MokeSell** is a web-based marketplace platform that allows users to buy and sell products online. The platform provides a structured way for users to list items, browse available products, and find great deals with ease.

This repository contains the source code for MokeSell, including the frontend and backend implementation. It is designed to demonstrate web development concepts such as **APIs, database implementations , and responsive UI design**.

üé® This project is built using:

-   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend
-   **RestDB** for database
- **Cloudinary** for File hosting

This documentation explains the functionality,  structure and the technology used in the project. 



## üìù Project Breakdown & Implementation

**Contributor/Author**: Linn Thit Aung


### Main Page (index.html)

The **index page** serves as the main landing page for the Mokesell website. This page is crucial because it offers the first impression of the website and acts as a central hub for users to explore various products.
We use **RestDB** as our database to store all our data because it is flexible and easy to use.

### Extracting Data from RestDB

**RESTdb** allows for easy management and retrieval of product details like name, description, price, and images, all of which are displayed on the index page for the users to explore. Here‚Äôs how our data extraction works:


#### 1. **Setting Up RestDB  API**


RestDB provides an API endpoint that allows us to interact with our database and retrieve data using simple HTTP requests (e.g., GET requests). In this project, we set up RestDB to store all the product data, including the product name, price, description, and image URLs. The API endpoint URL is configured to point to the specific collection of product data in the database.

For example, our endpoint look something like this:
```
https://mokesell-database-name.restdb.io/rest/listings

```

Here, `listings` is the name of the collection containing all the product data.

#### 2. **Fetching Data from RestDB Using JavaScript**

To display the product data dynamically, we use JavaScript‚Äôs `fetch()` method to send a GET request to the RestDB API endpoint. This fetch request retrieves the product information stored in the database and returns it as JSON data, which can then be processed and displayed on the index page.

Here‚Äôs an example of how the data is fetched:

```javascript
async function fetchProducts() {
    if (loading || !hasMore) return;  // Prevent if already loading or no more products
    loading = true;
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`${RESTDB_URL}apikey=${RESTDB_API_KEY}&skip=${(page - 1) * 12}&max=12`);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch products');
        
        const products = await response.json();
        if (products.length < 12) hasMore = false;  // Stop fetching more

        displayProducts(products);  // Display fetched products
        page++;  // Move to the next page
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    } finally {
        loading = false;
    }
}
```

In the above code:

-   We use `fetch()` to make an API request to the RestDB endpoint.
-   The API key is used for authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.
-   The response is processed with `.json()` to convert the JSON data into a JavaScript object.
-   If the request is successful, the `products` (which contains the product information) is passed to the `displayProducts()` function.


#### 3. **Displaying Product Cards on the Index Page**

Once the product data is fetched, we need to dynamically display it on the index page. The `createProductCard()` function is responsible for this task, where it loops through the fetched product data and creates a new product card for each item.

Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of how the `createProductCard()` function works:

```javascript
function createProductCard(product) {
    const sanitizedProduct = {
        title: sanitizeHTML(product.title),
        description: truncateText(sanitizeHTML(product.description), 15),
        price: Number(product.price).toFixed(2),
        coverImage: sanitizeHTML(product.coverImage),
        likes: parseInt(product.likes) || 0
    };

    return `
        <div class="product-card">
            <div class="product-image" style="background-image: url('${sanitizedProduct.coverImage}')"></div>
            <div class="product-info">
                <h3>${sanitizedProduct.title}</h3>
                <p class="product-description">${sanitizedProduct.description}</p>
                <div class="price">$${sanitizedProduct.price}</div>
                <div class="like-container">
                    <span class="like-count">${sanitizedProduct.likes}</span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

In this code:

-   The `product` object contains all the necessary details for a product (such as title, description, price, etc.).
-   We sanitize the product's data to prevent potential security issues with untrusted content.
-   We create a product card by inserting the sanitized product information into an HTML structure.
-   The `product-card` element is then appended to the parent container (`product-container`) on the page.

This results in a series of product cards being generated dynamically from the fetched product data and displayed in the user interface.

#### 4. **Error Handling**

When interacting with external APIs, it‚Äôs important to handle potential errors, such as network failures or invalid responses from the server. In the `fetch()` request, we included a `.catch()` block to log any errors that might occur during the request process.

Additionally, it‚Äôs good practice to provide the user with feedback if the products cannot be loaded. This can be done by displaying an error message on the page in case the `fetch()` request fails.

Our example usage:

```javascript
} catch (error) {
	console.error('Error fetching products:',  error);
	document.getElementById('products').innerHTML  =
	'<p>Error loading products. Please try again later.</p>';
}
```
## Fundamentals of RestDB
**Contributor/Author**:Tan Si Ming Scott
### üìù RestDB Data Manipulation
Now that we have fetched the data using the **RestDB** api, we have to add on, modify or even delete the queried data.This can be done in many ways.
### POST Method
To create an entry in the collection of your choosing, the **POST** method is used. The **POST** method adds entered information into the database if there is a corresponding field. In our case, the **POST** method is used to allow the users of our website to create their product listings, and for those listings to be recorded inside our database.

Here is an example of a framework code we used using the **POST** method:
```javascript
async  function  handleListingSubmit(event) {

event.preventDefault();
const title=document.getElementById('title').value.trim();
const description=document.getElementById('description').value.trim();
const price=document.getElementById('price').value.trim();
const category=document.getElementById('category').value;
const condition=document.getElementById('condition').value;
const  response=await fetch(RESTDB_LISTINGS_URL,{
method:  'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type':  'application/json',
'x-apikey':  API_KEY
},
body:  JSON.stringify({
title,
description,
category,
price,
condition,
}}
```
The above code defines the values by referencing the accompanying IDs in the HTML form, before fetching the url and posting an entry into the collection with the specified values in each variable.


### PATCH Method
The **PATCH** method is used when you want to modify an existing entry inside the **RestDB** database.The **PATCH** method allows you to override existing data in entries and/or add new data into empty fields for the entry. The **PATCH** method is used to enable our users to change the details of their listing, and have that change reflected in the database.

Here is an example of a framework code we made using the **PATCH** method:
```javascript
async function handleModifySubmit(event) {
const listingID = document.getElementById('ListingID').value.trim();
const title = document.getElementById('newTitle').value.trim();
const description = document.getElementById('newDescription').value.trim();
const price = parseFloat(document.getElementById('newPrice').value.trim());
const category = document.getElementById('newCategory').value.trim();
const condition = document.getElementById('newCondition').value.trim();
try{
const modifyUrl =`${RESTDB_LISTINGS_URL}/${recordId}`;
const modifyResponse = await  fetch(modifyUrl, {
method: 'PATCH',
headers: {
'Content-Type':  'application/json',
'x-apikey':  API_KEY
},
body: JSON.stringify({
title,
description,
price,
category,
condition
});
```
The above code defines new values for the fields that are being overridden, with a predefined function outside this code to query the database and reference the given id. It then changes the entry based on the information given.

### Delete Method

The **DELETE** Method is used when you want to delete an entry from a collection.The **DELETE** Method allows our users to delete their listings from the database, if they are no longer selling the product.

Here is an example of a framework code we made using the **DELETE** Method:
```javascript
const ListingID = document.getElementById('ListingID').value.trim();
try{
const deleteUrl = `${RESTDB_LISTINGS_URL}?q={"listingID":"${ListingID}"}`;
const  response  =  await  fetch(deleteUrl, {
method:  'DELETE',
headers: {
'Content-Type':  'application/json',
'x-apikey':  API_KEY
}
});
```
The above code cross references the given ListingID across the collection and deletes the corresponding entry in the collection.

## Usage Of Cloudinary (File Hosting Service)
**Contributor/Author**:Tan Si Ming Scott

### Why Cloudinary over RestDB
We chose to use Cloudinary to store our images due to the increased size of storage it can hold compared to the database, and it allows us to access and display images faster instead of having to send more requests to the database.

**Setting Up Cloudinary**
The prerequisites for cloudinary usage are, an active cloudinary account and an upload preset
```javascript
const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL = 'https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/upload';
const CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = 'UPLOAD_PRESET';
```
Above are examples of cloudinary upload URL and upload preset

---
### Cloudinary Data Manipulation

**1. Uploading to Cloudinary**

Cloudinary, similar to **RestDB** uses the  **POST** method to upload data into the cloud servers.
For example:
```javascript
async function uploadImageToCloudinary(file) {
const formData = new  FormData();
formData.append('file', file);
formData.append('upload_preset', CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET);
const  response  =  await  fetch(CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL, {
method:  'POST',
body:  formData
});
}
```
The above example builds a formdata object that includes the file and an upload preset, then sends this data in a **POST** request using the fetch API to Cloudinary.

**2. Displaying images uploaded in Cloudinary through links**

Now that the image is in Cloudinary's Servers, we can very simply just display the image with a single line of code.
```javascript
<img src="CLOUDINARY LINK" alt = "image" class = "cloudinary-image">
```
with a little formatting we can display it onto the html page.

## Listing Creation Form Backend(sellScript.js)

**Contributor/Author**:Tan Si Ming Scott

For the creation of an entry into our database, the **POST** Method is mainly used. Cloudinary was also used for image uploading.

 **Full Function**
 ```javascript
 async function handleListingSubmit(event) {
event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the default form submission behavior
// Prevent submitting again if already submitting
if(isSubmitting)return;
// Mark the form as submitting
isSubmitting = true;
// Disable the submit button to prevent multiple submissions
elements.submitButton.disabled  =  true;
const meetupCheckbox = document.getElementById("meetup");
const  deliveryCheckbox  =  document.getElementById("delivery");
const  dealLocationInput  =  document.getElementById("dealLocation");
// Only include dealLocation if meetup is selected
const  dealLocation  =  meetupCheckbox.checked  ?  dealLocationInput.value  :  "NA";
const  delivery  =  deliveryCheckbox.checked  ?  true  :  false;
const  formData  = {
title: elements.title.value,
description: elements.description.value,
price: elements.price.value,
category: elements.categoryInput.value,
condition: elements.conditionInput.value,
dealLocation: dealLocation,
delivery: delivery,
sellerID: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user")).id,
sellerName: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user")).name
};
const validationErrors = validateForm(formData);
if (validationErrors.length > 0){
alert(validationErrors.join('\n'));
// Re-enable the submit button if validation fails
elements.submitButton.disabled  =  false;
isSubmitting  =  false; // Mark as not submitting anymore
return;
} 
try {
// Upload images to Cloudinary before submitting
const  imageUrls  =  await  uploadImagesToCloudinary(state.uploadedImages);
if (!imageUrls.length) throw  new  Error("Failed to upload images");
// Rearrange images so the cover image comes first
const  orderedImages  = [imageUrls[state.coverImageIndex], ...imageUrls.filter((_, i) =>  i !== state.coverImageIndex)];
const imageString  =  orderedImages.join(",");
// Send the listing data including the image URLs
const response  =  await  fetch(RESTDB_LISTINGS_URL, {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
'x-apikey': API_KEY
},
body:  JSON.stringify({
...formData,
coverImage:  orderedImages[0],
images:  imageString  // Comma-separated image URLs
})
});
if (!response.ok) {
throw  new  Error(`Failed to create listing: ${response.status}  ${response.statusText}`);
}
const result = await  response.json();
alert("Listing created successfully!");
resetForm();
} catch (error) {
console.error("Error:", error);
alert("An error occurred: "  +  error.message);
} finally {
// Re-enable the submit button after the request is complete
elements.submitButton.disabled  =  false;
isSubmitting  =  false; // Mark as not submitting anymore
}
}
```
### Form Submission Process

The function `handleListingSubmit(event)` is responsible for handling the submission of a new product listing. It ensures proper validation, prevents duplicate submissions, uploads images to Cloudinary, and finally sends the listing data to the database.

1.  **Prevents multiple submissions**:
    
    -   A flag (`isSubmitting`) ensures that users do not accidentally submit the form multiple times.
    -   The submit button is disabled while processing the request.
2.  **Handles meetup and delivery options**:
    
    -   If "Meetup" is selected, `dealLocation` is included; otherwise, it's marked as `"NA"`.
    -   If "Delivery" is checked, it's set as `true`.
3.  **Validates form data**:
    
    -   If validation fails, an alert is shown, and submission is stopped.
4.  **Uploads images to Cloudinary**:
    
    -   Images are uploaded before submitting the listing.
    -   The cover image is placed first in the order.
5.  **Sends listing data to the database**:
    
    -   Uses the **POST** method to send the listing details to the database along with image URLs.
