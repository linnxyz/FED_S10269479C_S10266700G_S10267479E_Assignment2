# üìù Project Breakdown & Implementation

**Contributor/Author**: Linn Thit Aung

## 1. Main Page (index.html)

The **index page** serves as the main landing page for the Mokesell website. This page is crucial because it offers the first impression of the website and acts as a central hub for users to explore various products.
We use **RestDB** as our database to store all our data because it is flexible and easy to use.

### Extracting Data from RestDB

**RestDB** allows for easy management and retrieval of product details like name, description, price, and images, all of which are displayed on the index page for the users to explore. Here‚Äôs how our data extraction works:

#### Setting Up RestDB  API

RestDB provides an API endpoint that allows us to interact with our database and retrieve data using simple HTTP requests (e.g., GET requests). In this project, we set up RestDB to store all the product data, including the product name, price, description, and image URLs. The API endpoint URL is configured to point to the specific collection of product data in the database.

For example, our endpoint look something like this:
```
https://mokesell-database-name.restdb.io/rest/listings
```

#### Fetching Data from RestDB Using JavaScript

To display the product data dynamically, we use JavaScript‚Äôs `fetch()` method to send a GET request to the RestDB API endpoint. This fetch request retrieves the product information stored in the database and returns it as JSON data, which can then be processed and displayed on the index page.

Here‚Äôs an example of how the data is fetched:

```javascript
async function fetchProducts() {
    if (loading || !hasMore) return;  // Prevent if already loading or no more products
    loading = true;
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`${RESTDB_URL}apikey=${RESTDB_API_KEY}&skip=${(page - 1) * 12}&max=12`);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch products');
        
        const products = await response.json();
        if (products.length < 12) hasMore = false;  // Stop fetching more

        displayProducts(products);  // Display fetched products
        page++;  // Move to the next page
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    } finally {
        loading = false;
    }
}
```

In the above code:

-   We use `fetch()` to make an API request to the RestDB endpoint.
-   The API key is used for authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.
-   The response is processed with `.json()` to convert the JSON data into a JavaScript object.
-   If the request is successful, the `products` (which contains the product information) is passed to the `displayProducts()` function.


#### Displaying Product Cards on the Index Page

Once the product data is fetched, we need to dynamically display it on the index page. The `createProductCard()` function is responsible for this task, where it loops through the fetched product data and creates a new product card for each item.

Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of how the `createProductCard()` function works:

```javascript
function createProductCard(product) {
    const sanitizedProduct = {
        title: sanitizeHTML(product.title),
        description: truncateText(sanitizeHTML(product.description), 15),
        price: Number(product.price).toFixed(2),
        coverImage: sanitizeHTML(product.coverImage),
        likes: parseInt(product.likes) || 0
    };

    return `
        <div class="product-card">
            <div class="product-image" style="background-image: url('${sanitizedProduct.coverImage}')"></div>
            <div class="product-info">
                <h3>${sanitizedProduct.title}</h3>
                <p class="product-description">${sanitizedProduct.description}</p>
                <div class="price">$${sanitizedProduct.price}</div>
                <div class="like-container">
                    <span class="like-count">${sanitizedProduct.likes}</span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

In this code:

-   The `product` object contains all the necessary details for a product (such as title, description, price, etc.).
-   We sanitize the product's data to prevent potential security issues with untrusted content.
-   We create a product card by inserting the sanitized product information into an HTML structure.
-   The `product-card` element is then appended to the parent container (`product-container`) on the page.

This results in a series of product cards being generated dynamically from the fetched product data and displayed in the user interface.

#### Error Handling

When interacting with external APIs, it‚Äôs important to handle potential errors, such as network failures or invalid responses from the server. In the `fetch()` request, we included a `.catch()` block to log any errors that might occur during the request process.

Additionally, it‚Äôs good practice to provide the user with feedback if the products cannot be loaded. This can be done by displaying an error message on the page in case the `fetch()` request fails.

Here's our example usage:

```javascript
} catch (error) {
	console.error('Error fetching products:',  error);
	document.getElementById('products').innerHTML  =
	'<p>Error loading products. Please try again later.</p>';
}
```

#### Additions:
There is 2 sections in the index page to display products, **Trending** and **All**. Trending section only show the top 10 products with the most likes and All section show everything with no specific sorting. Index page also feature **Reviews** given to MokeSell by users, **FAQs**, and **Footer**.

## 2. Product Page (product.html)
**Contributor/Author**: Linn Thit Aung

The **Product Page** is where users can view detailed information about a specific product after selecting it from the index page. When a user clicks on a product, its data is stored in localStorage under `clickedProduct`, allowing the details to persist when navigating to `product.html`.

### Storing Clicked Product Data

When a product is clicked on the index page, its details (such as title, description, price, image, and seller info) are stored in `localStorage` using JavaScript like this:

```javascript
function handleProductClick(product) {
    localStorage.setItem('clickedProduct', JSON.stringify(product));
    window.location.href = 'product.html'; // Navigate to the product page
}
```

### Retrieving and Displaying Product Data

On `product.html`, the stored data is retrieved and displayed dynamically:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',  ()  =>  {
	// Get the clickedProduct from localStorage
	const  clickedProduct  =  JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('clickedProduct'));
	if (clickedProduct) {
		// Update the HTML with the product details
		document.querySelector('.title').textContent  =  clickedProduct.title;
		document.querySelector('.description').textContent  =  clickedProduct.description;
		document.querySelector('.condition').textContent  =  clickedProduct.condition;
		document.querySelector('.price').textContent  =  `$${clickedProduct.price}`;
		document.querySelector('.location').textContent  =  clickedProduct.location;
		document.querySelector('.seller-name').textContent  =  clickedProduct.sellerName;
```

### Google Maps Integration

To enhance the user experience, we integrated the **Google Maps API** to display the meet-up location set by the seller for each product. Additionally, we allow buyers to enter their desired location, and using the **Google Distance Matrix API**, we calculate the distance and estimated travel time using public transport.

![enter image description here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtpvsevc7/image/upload/v1739108155/rrh2n9kuitf4artoaohh.png)
#### Displaying the Seller‚Äôs Meet-Up Location

Each product listing includes a meet-up location specified by the seller. Using the **Google Maps JavaScript API**, we display this location as a marker on an embedded map.

#### Fetching and Displaying the Meet-Up Location

```javascript
let map;
function initMap() {
    const clickedProduct = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('clickedProduct'));
    if (clickedProduct && clickedProduct.location) {
        const geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
        geocoder.geocode({ address: clickedProduct.location }, (results, status) => {
            if (status === "OK") {
                const location = results[0].geometry.location;
                map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), {
                    center: location,
                    zoom: 15, // Adjust zoom level as needed
                });
                new google.maps.Marker({
                    position: location,
                    map: map,
                    title: clickedProduct.title || "Product Location",
                });
            }
```
The above code is part of the implementation to initialize the Google Map on the product page. It retrieves the selected product‚Äôs location from localStorage, uses the **Google Geocoding API** to convert the address into coordinates, and then initializes a map centered on that location. A marker is also placed to indicate the seller‚Äôs meetup point for the product.

#### Allowing Buyers to Enter Their Desired Location

To help buyers plan their travel, we provide an input field where they can enter their location. Once they input their address, we use the **Google Places Autocomplete API** to suggest valid locations.

```html
<input  type="text"  id="origin"  placeholder="Enter an address to calculate distance from the meet up location"  required  />
<button  type="submit">Calculate Distance</button>
```
We used **Google Places Autocomplete API** in the create listing (sell.html) as well. To read more about how it works, [Go to Create Listing (sell.html)](#3-create-listing-sellhtml)
 
#### Calculating Distance and Travel Time

When the buyer enters their location, we use the **Google Distance Matrix API** to calculate the distance and estimated travel time using public transport.

Part of the code looks something like this:

```javascript
const  service  =  new  google.maps.DistanceMatrixService();
service.getDistanceMatrix(
	{
		origins: [origin],
		destinations: [destination],
		travelMode:  google.maps.TravelMode.TRANSIT,
	},
```
In this code:
-   `DistanceMatrixService` initializes the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, which helps calculate distances and travel times.
-    These parameters `origins` and  `destinations` take in the seller's meetup location and the buyer's entered location.
-   `travelMode: google.maps.TravelMode.TRANSIT` specifies that the estimated time should be calculated using public transport.

## 3. Create Listing (sell.html)
**Contributor/Author**: Linn Thit Aung

This page allows users to create new product listings by entering relevant details such as product title, description, price, images, and a preferred meetup location etc. **Icons** are more prominently used in the design to make the form visually appealing and easy to understand.

![Product Category Screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtpvsevc7/image/upload/v1739110563/t01sgc9yhnusa8erbn2c.png)
### Google Places Autocomplete Integration
The **Google Places Autocomplete** feature is implemented in the `dealLocation`. It helps users by providing location suggestions as they type, making it faster and easier to select a valid meetup location. By restricting the suggestions to **Singapore**, the feature ensures that users only see relevant locations. This is useful for improving accuracy, reducing errors, and enhancing the overall user experience when creating a listing.

![enter image description here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtpvsevc7/image/upload/v1739110714/fttbqhyo80wpqxfanqmi.png)
```javascript
function initAutocomplete() {
    const originInput = document.getElementById('dealLocation');

    if (!originInput) {
        console.error("Input field not found!");
        return;
    }

    originAutocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(originInput, {
        componentRestrictions: { country: "SG" } // Restrict to Singapore
    });
}
```
In above code:
-   `originInput` stores the input element with the ID `dealLocation`, which is where users enter their meetup location.
 -   `originAutocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(originInput, {...});` initializes the Google Maps Places Autocomplete functionality on the input field. This provides suggestions for places as the user types.
	-   `componentRestrictions: { country: "SG" }` restricts the autocomplete to locations within Singapore, ensuring that users are selecting valid, local locations.

### Sending listing data to RestDB

[Go to SCOTT (sell.html)](#3-create-listing-sellhtml)

## 4. Log In / Register (login.html)

**Contributor/Author**: Linn Thit Aung

This page allows users to either create a new account or log in to an existing one. This page serves as the gateway for users to access their personalized experience on the site, including features like managing listings, viewing saved items, and making purchases.

-   **User Registration**: New users can sign up by providing basic information such as their email and password.
    
-   **User Login**: Existing users can log in by entering their credentials. The login form checks the entered information against the database to authenticate the user and grant them access to their account.

### Password Hashing

To securely store the passwords in our database, **SHA-256** hashing algorithm is applied on the password before being sent out to the database.
```javascript
async  function  hashPassword(password)  {
	// Use SHA-256 for hashing
	const  encoder  =  new  TextEncoder();
	const  data  =  encoder.encode(password);
	const  hashBuffer  =  await  crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256',  data);
	
	// Convert buffer to hex string
	const  hashArray  =  Array.from(new  Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
	const  hashHex  =  hashArray.map(b  =>  b.toString(16).padStart(2,  '0')).join('');
	return  hashHex;
}
```
