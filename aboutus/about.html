        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          At MokeSell, we started with a simple belief: great electronics deserve a second chance. What began as a passion for sustainability and affordability grew into a mission to make quality tech accessible to everyone.

          We saw how many perfectly good devices were discarded simply because they weren’t brand-new. Determined to change that, we built a platform that breathes new life into second-hand electronics. Every product we offer is carefully inspected, refurbished, and ready to perform like new—all while helping reduce e-waste and protect our planet.
          
          Today, we’re proud to empower smart shoppers like you to save money, embrace sustainability, and give electronics a new purpose. Together, let’s prove that second-hand can be a first choice.
